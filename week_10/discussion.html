                These discussion prompts are designed to move beyond technical definitions toward
                critical analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Use them to spark deeper conversation
                about <em>why</em> CNNs revolutionized computer vision and what that means for AI.

                <h3>1. Why Do Convolutions Work for Vision?</h3>
                <p>
                    CNNs exploit spatial locality—nearby pixels matter more than distant ones. But why
                    does this assumption hold, and when might it break down?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>Humans recognize objects regardless of position. How do CNNs achieve translation invariance?
                    </li>
                    <li>Are there visual tasks where local patterns don't matter? (Abstract art? Optical illusions?)
                    </li>
                    <li>CNNs were inspired by the visual cortex. Is this biomimicry or coincidence?</li>
                    <li>Would aliens with different eyes invent different architectures?</li>

                <h3>2. The Transfer Learning Paradox</h3>
                <p>
                    Pre-trained models on ImageNet enable powerful vision systems. But ImageNet was built
                    from a particular worldview. What comes along for the ride?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>ImageNet categories include dog breeds but not vegetables from non-Western cuisines. What's
                        included and excluded?</li>
                    <li>If models learn "chair" from Western furniture, will they recognize chairs from other cultures?
                    </li>
                    <li>Transfer learning democratizes AI (anyone can use), but who controls the foundation models?</li>
                    <li>Should there be different pre-trained models for different cultures or contexts?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Test a pre-trained model on images from different cultural contexts.

                <h3>3. What Do Filters "See"?</h3>
                <p>
                    We visualize learned filters and say "this detects edges" or "this detects eyes."
                    But is that interpretation accurate, or are we projecting human concepts?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>When we label a filter as an "edge detector," are we discovering or inventing that
                        interpretation?</li>
                    <li>Deeper layers have "higher-level" features. What does "higher-level" mean?</li>
                    <li>Can we trust feature visualizations? Do they show what the network actually uses?</li>
                    <li>If two filters produce similar outputs for different reasons, does it matter?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. The Compute Cost of Vision</h3>
                <p>
                    Training large vision models requires enormous computational resources. What are
                    the implications for who can do AI research?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>If only large companies can train foundation models, what happens to academic research?</li>
                    <li>Training GPT-4V reportedly cost $100M+. Who benefits from such investments?</li>
                    <li>Environmental cost: large models have significant carbon footprints. How do we weigh benefits
                        and costs?</li>
                    <li>Does efficient research become more valuable as compute costs rise?</li>

                <h3>5. Pooling as Information Loss</h3>
                <p>
                    Pooling deliberately throws away information for the sake of invariance and efficiency.
                    What's lost, and does it matter?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>Max pooling keeps the strongest signal. What if subtle signals matter?</li>
                    <li>In medical imaging, could pooling discard diagnostically relevant details?</li>
                    <li>Strided convolutions are replacing pooling. Does this solve the problem or just hide it?</li>
                    <li>Is there a philosophical parallel—summarizing always loses something?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. When CNNs Fail</h3>
                <p>
                    CNNs are brittle in ways humans are not. Small perturbations (adversarial examples)
                    can completely fool them. What does this reveal about their "understanding"?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>Adversarial patches can make a stop sign invisible to self-driving cars. How worried should we
                        be?</li>
                    <li>Humans and CNNs fail differently. Does this mean they "see" differently?</li>
                    <li>If we don't understand why CNNs fail, can we trust them in critical applications?</li>
                    <li>Should adversarial robustness be a requirement for deployment?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Generate simple adversarial examples. Discuss what makes CNNs
                    vulnerable.</p>

            <h2>Discussion Facilitation Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Think-Pair-Share:</strong> Give 2 min to think, 3 min in pairs, then class discussion.</li>
                <li><strong>Devil's Advocate:</strong> Assign students to argue positions they disagree with.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Stakes:</strong> Tie abstract questions to real systems (medical AI, hiring tools,
                    self-driving cars).</li>
                <li><strong>Discomfort is Learning:</strong> The best discussions happen when there's no clear right
                    answer.</li>
                <li><strong>Return to Fundamentals:</strong> Circle back to technical content after abstract
                    discussion—"How does this change how you'd build a model?"</li>
            </ul>
