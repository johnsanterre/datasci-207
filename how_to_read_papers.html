            <h1>How to Read ML Papers</h1>

            <p>
                Throughout this course, you will encounter links to foundational research papers.
                Reading academic papers is a skill that improves with practice. This guide offers
                strategies to help you read efficiently and extract key insights.
            </p>

            <h2>The Three-Pass Approach</h2>

            <p>
                Do not try to read a paper linearly from start to finish. Instead, make multiple
                passes with different goals.
            </p>

            <h3>First Pass: Survey (5-10 minutes)</h3>
            <p>Get a high-level understanding of what the paper is about.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read the title, abstract, and introduction</li>
                <li>Read all section headings</li>
                <li>Look at figures and tables (often the most informative part)</li>
                <li>Read the conclusion</li>
                <li>Glance at the references to see what work it builds on</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                After this pass, you should be able to answer: What problem does this paper solve?
                What is the main contribution? Is this paper relevant to what I need to learn?
            </p>

            <h3>Second Pass: Comprehension (30-60 minutes)</h3>
            <p>Understand the main ideas without getting lost in details.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Read the paper more carefully, but skip complex proofs or derivations</li>
                <li>Annotate key points in the margins</li>
                <li>Pay attention to figures and understand what each one shows</li>
                <li>Note terms or concepts you do not understand for later lookup</li>
                <li>Summarize the main method in your own words</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Third Pass: Critical Reading (1-2 hours, if needed)</h3>
            <p>Deep dive for full understanding.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Work through the math and derivations</li>
                <li>Question assumptions and identify limitations</li>
                <li>Think about how you would implement the method</li>
                <li>Consider how this work connects to other things you know</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What to Focus On</h2>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Section</th>
                        <th>What to Extract</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Abstract</td>
                        <td>Problem, method summary, key result (one sentence each)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Introduction</td>
                        <td>Motivation, why existing solutions are insufficient</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Related Work</td>
                        <td>Context and positioning (often skimmable on first read)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Method</td>
                        <td>The core contribution; focus here</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Experiments</td>
                        <td>What datasets, baselines, and metrics were used</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Results</td>
                        <td>Key numbers and comparisons; look at tables and figures</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Conclusion</td>
                        <td>Summary and future directions</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>What to Skip (Initially)</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Detailed proofs (unless you need them)</li>
                <li>Exhaustive related work sections</li>
                <li>Appendices and supplementary material</li>
                <li>Implementation details that are not central to understanding</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Taking Notes</h2>

            <p>For each paper you read, try to write down:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Problem:</strong> What problem is being solved?</li>
                <li><strong>Key Insight:</strong> What is the main idea or contribution?</li>
                <li><strong>Method:</strong> How does it work (in your own words)?</li>
                <li><strong>Results:</strong> What are the main findings?</li>
                <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> What are the weaknesses or open questions?</li>
                <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> How does this connect to what I am learning?</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Dealing with Difficulty</h2>

            <p>It is normal to not understand everything on the first read.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accept that some parts will be unclear initially</li>
                <li>Look up unfamiliar terms and notation</li>
                <li>Read cited papers if you need more background</li>
                <li>Discuss with classmates or instructors</li>
                <li>Return to the paper after learning more context</li>
            </ul>
