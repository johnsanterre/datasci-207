            <p>
                These discussion prompts are designed to move beyond technical definitions toward
                critical analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Use them to spark deeper conversation
                about <em>why</em> we seek structure without labels.

                <h3>1. Finding Structure Without Ground Truth</h3>
                <p>
                    In unsupervised learning, there are no "correct answers." We find patterns,
                    but how do we know if they're real or artifacts? What does "real" even mean here?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>If a clustering algorithm finds 5 groups, were those groups "there" before we looked?</li>
                    <li>Astronomers found constellations. Are constellations "real"?</li>
                    <li>Could two valid clusterings of the same data completely contradict each other?</li>
                    <li>How do we distinguish pattern discovery from pattern imposition?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Show the same data clustered by different algorithms. Discuss which is
                    "right."</p>

                <h3>2. The Politics of Clustering People</h3>
                <p>
                    Clustering customers, patients, or students puts people into groups they didn't choose.
                    What are the implications of algorithmic categorization?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>If a marketing algorithm puts you in "budget-conscious shoppers," does something change about
                        you?</li>
                    <li>How is algorithmic clustering like and unlike social categories (race, class, gender)?</li>
                    <li>Who should have access to cluster assignments? Should individuals know their cluster?</li>
                    <li>Can clustering reinforce stereotypes, even if the algorithm is "just finding patterns"?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Have students describe how they'd feel being assigned to different cluster
                    names.</p>

                <h3>3. Choosing K: The Number of Groups</h3>
                <p>
                    How many clusters exist is not inherent in the data—it's a choice.
                    What does this reveal about the nature of categories?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>The elbow method suggests K, but there's often no clear elbow. What then?</li>
                    <li>Is there a "true" number of human personality types? Music genres? Diseases?</li>
                    <li>More clusters = more precision. Fewer = more simplicity. How do we balance?</li>
                    <li>Could the "right" number of clusters depend on what we plan to do with them?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Show silhouette scores for K=2 to K=10. Have groups argue for different
                    values of K.</p>

                <h3>4. Dimensionality Reduction as Compression</h3>
                <p>
                    PCA reduces 1000 dimensions to 10 by keeping "what matters most."
                    But who decides what matters? What's lost in compression?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>PCA keeps directions of maximum variance. Is variance always the right criterion?</li>
                    <li>When we compress faces to 50 principal components, are we still representing people?</li>
                    <li>Compression sacrifices detail for tractability. What's the analog in human cognition?</li>
                    <li>If the discarded dimensions contain minority representation, what are the ethics?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Show PCA reconstructions at different numbers of components. Discuss
                    what's lost.</p>

                <h3>5. What is Similarity?</h3>
                <p>
                    Clustering requires defining similarity. But similarity is not objective—it
                    depends on which features matter. How does this shape what we find?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>Are a whale and a fish similar? It depends on whether you measure genes or appearance.</li>
                    <li>Euclidean distance treats all features equally. When is that appropriate?</li>
                    <li>Could two similarity measures produce opposite conclusions about group membership?</li>
                    <li>How do humans judge similarity? Is it consistent?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Ask students to rank similarity of pairs. Note where they disagree.</p>

                <h3>6. Unsupervised Learning as Exploration</h3>
                <p>
                    Unsupervised learning is often used for exploration before prediction.
                    But exploration can lead us to see patterns that aren't there. How do we stay honest?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>If you explore data and then test hypotheses on the same data, what could go wrong?</li>
                    <li>Is unsupervised learning more or less prone to confirmation bias than supervised?</li>
                    <li>How should exploratory findings be communicated? With what caveats?</li>
                    <li>"I don't know what I'll find, but I'll know it when I see it"—is this science?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Run clustering on random data. Note how compelling the "patterns" look.

            <h2>Discussion Facilitation Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Think-Pair-Share:</strong> Give 2 min to think, 3 min in pairs, then class discussion.</li>
                <li><strong>Devil's Advocate:</strong> Assign students to argue positions they disagree with.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Stakes:</strong> Tie abstract questions to real systems (medical AI, hiring tools,
                    self-driving cars).</li>
                <li><strong>Discomfort is Learning:</strong> The best discussions happen when there's no clear right
                    answer.</li>
                <li><strong>Return to Fundamentals:</strong> Circle back to technical content after abstract
                    discussion—"How does this change how you'd build a model?"</li>
            </ul>
