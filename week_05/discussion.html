            <p>
                These discussion prompts are designed to move beyond technical definitions toward
                critical analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Use them to spark deeper conversation
                about <em>why</em> metrics matter and what they hide.

                <h3>1. The Politics of Precision and Recall</h3>
                <p>
                    Precision favors caution; recall favors vigilance. This trade-off is not just
                    mathematical—it's political. Who wins and loses in this trade-off?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>In fraud detection, banks prefer precision (don't annoy good customers). Merchants prefer recall
                        (catch all fraud). Who decides?</li>
                    <li>If a cancer screen has high recall but low precision, patients face unnecessary anxiety and
                        procedures. Is that acceptable?</li>
                    <li>Is "presumption of innocence" (legal standard) essentially a precision argument?</li>
                    <li>Can you think of a system that should maximize recall even at the cost of many false alarms?
                    </li>

                <h3>2. Class Imbalance as a Social Phenomenon</h3>
                <p>
                    "Imbalanced classes" is a technical term, but imbalance reflects real-world rarity.
                    Why are some things rare, and what happens when we oversample or undersample?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>Fraud is rare because most people are honest. If we oversample fraud, what assumptions are we
                        making about human nature?</li>
                    <li>SMOTE creates synthetic minority examples. What does it mean to create synthetic fraudsters or
                        cancer patients?</li>
                    <li>If we balance classes artificially, does the model learn about the real world or a fantasy?</li>
                    <li>Is class imbalance a problem to be solved, or information to be respected?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Aggregating Metrics: What Gets Hidden?</h3>
                <p>
                    F1-score, macro-average, micro-average—we combine metrics into single numbers.
                    What simplicity gives us, it takes away in understanding. What's hidden in aggregation?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>If overall accuracy is 90%, but one group has 60% accuracy, is the model "90% good"?</li>
                    <li>Macro-averaging treats all classes equally. When is that fair? When is it unfair?</li>
                    <li>An F1 of 0.8 could come from many different precision-recall combinations. Does that matter?
                    </li>
                    <li>When executives ask "how good is this model?" what should you actually tell them?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Show the same model evaluated by multiple metrics. Discuss how each tells

                <h3>4. The Confusion Matrix as Moral Inventory</h3>
                <p>
                    Each cell of the confusion matrix represents a different kind of error.
                    Behind each number is a person with a different experience. What are their stories?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>What's it like to be a false positive in a criminal prediction system? A false negative?</li>
                    <li>In medicine, a false positive leads to needless treatment; a false negative means missed
                        disease. Which is worse?</li>
                    <li>The matrix makes errors look equivalent within cells. Are all false positives equally bad?</li>
                    <li>If you could only minimize one cell, which would you choose? Why?</li>

                <h3>5. Multiclass: When Reality Escapes Categories</h3>
                <p>
                    Multiclass classification assumes examples belong to exactly one category.
                    But the world resists neat categorization. How do we handle multiplicity?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>A song is both "rock" and "pop." A patient has two diseases. How does classification handle
                        this?</li>
                    <li>Multi-label vs. multiclass: when should a system allow multiple labels?</li>
                    <li>Classification systems reify categories. Does Netflix's "genre" system change how we understand
                        film?</li>
                    <li>What happens when cultural categories don't translate? (e.g., emotion classification across
                        cultures)</li>

                <h3>6. ROC Curves and the Illusion of Choice</h3>
                <p>
                    ROC curves show all possible trade-offs. But having options doesn't mean we
                    know how to choose. What guidance do we actually have?
                </p>
                <ul class="probing-questions">
                    <li>The ROC curve shows what's possible. Who decides what's desirable?</li>
                    <li>AUC of 0.95 vs. 0.90: Is one model "better"? Does it depend on where on the curve you operate?
                    </li>
                    <li>If two stakeholders want different points on the ROC curve, how do you resolve the conflict?
                    </li>
                    <li>Could you explain an ROC curve to a non-technical decision-maker? Should you have to?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="activity-note">Try: Give an ROC curve with marked points. Have groups choose a point and
                    justify it to stakeholders.</p>

            <h2>Discussion Facilitation Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Think-Pair-Share:</strong> Give 2 min to think, 3 min in pairs, then class discussion.</li>
                <li><strong>Devil's Advocate:</strong> Assign students to argue positions they disagree with.</li>
                <li><strong>Real Stakes:</strong> Tie abstract questions to real systems (medical AI, hiring tools,
                    self-driving cars).</li>
                <li><strong>Discomfort is Learning:</strong> The best discussions happen when there's no clear right
                    answer.</li>
                <li><strong>Return to Fundamentals:</strong> Circle back to technical content after abstract
                    discussion—"How does this change how you'd build a model?"</li>
            </ul>
